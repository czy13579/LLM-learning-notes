The assistant tone is technical and scientific.\n\nHuman: Hello, who are you?\nAI: Greeting! I am an AI research assistant. How can I help you today?\nHuman: Can you tell me about the creation of blackholes?\nAI:\n\nZhipuAI: Certainly! The creation of black holes is a topic of interest in astrophysics and theoretical physics. Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. They are formed through various processes, and I'll outline a few of the most well-known methods:\n\n1. Stellar Collapse: The most common method by which black holes are formed is through the gravitational collapse of a massive star. When a star runs out of nuclear fuel, it starts to collapse under its own gravity. If the star's core is sufficiently massive, it can collapse to a point where its escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, forming a black hole.\n\n2. Supernova Explosion: In some cases, a star that is about to collapse into a black hole can explode as a supernova first. This explosion can either eject matter away from the star, preventing the formation of a black hole, or it can clear the way for the core to collapse further and form a black hole.\n\n3. Merger of Compact Objects: Another method for the formation of black holes is through the merger of two compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes themselves. This is known as a binary system. When these objects merge, they can form a larger black hole. This process is also thought to be a significant source of gravitational waves, which were directly detected for the first time in 2015.\n\n4. Cosmological Collapse: In the early universe, hypothetical \"primordial black holes\" could have formed from density perturbations in the cosmic microwave background soon after the Big Bang. These black holes would be much smaller than those formed from stellar collapse and are yet to be directly observed.\n\nThe formation of a black hole is still a topic of research, and new insights are continually being gained through observations in astronomy, particle physics, and the study of gravitational waves. If you have more specific questions about the physics behind black hole formation or any other topic, feel free to ask!\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt=\"\"\"\nThe following is a conversation with an AI research assistant.

They form from really heavy stars that have run out of energy. When a star uses up all its fuel, it collapses in on itself.\n\nIf the star is really, really heavy, it collapses all the way down to a point where gravity is so strong that even light can't escape. That's why we can't see black holes—they suck in everything, including light.\n\nScientists think that black holes start off small, but they can get bigger if they eat up other stuff in space, like gas or other stars. As they get bigger, they can pull in more and more stuff.\n\nSo, black holes are formed from the leftovers of big, old stars and they are so strong that they can't let anything go, not even light.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 代码生成","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt=\"\"\"\n/*\nAsk the user for their name and say \\\"Hello\\\"\n*/\n\"\"\"\ngenerator(prompt)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-02T07:36:46.967369Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-02T07:36:46.967736Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-02T07:36:54.280306Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-02T07:36:46.967708Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-02T07:36:54.279280Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"user: \n/*\nAsk the user for their name and say \"Hello\"\n*/\n\nZhipuAI: 在编写代码以询问用户的名字并说“你好”时，可以使用多种编程语言。以下是使用Python语言的一个简单示例：\n\n```python\n# Python 示例\nname = input(\"请输入您的名字：\")\nprint(f\"你好，{name}！\")\n```\n\n如果您需要其他编程语言的示例，或者需要帮助理解这段代码，请告诉我。\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 推理","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt=\"\"\"\nWhat is 9,000 * 9,000?\n\"\"\"\ngenerator(prompt)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-02T07:37:37.315144Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-02T07:37:37.315523Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-02T07:37:40.958564Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-02T07:37:37.315489Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-02T07:37:40.957334Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"user: \nWhat is 9,000 * 9,000?\n\nZhipuAI: 9,000 multiplied by 9,000 is 81,000,000.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt=\"\"\"\nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. \n\nA: \n\"\"\"\ngenerator(prompt)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-02T07:38:40.187876Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-02T07:38:40.188296Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-02T07:38:48.889948Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-02T07:38:40.188263Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-02T07:38:48.888578Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"user: \nThe odd numbers in this group add up to an even number: 15, 32, 5, 13, 82, 7, 1. \n\nA: \n\nZhipuAI: To verify if the sum of the odd numbers in this group adds up to an even number, we need to add all the odd numbers together and then determine if the sum is even or odd.\n\nLet's add the odd numbers:\n\n15 + 5 + 13 + 7 + 1 = 41\n\nNow, we need to determine if 41 is an even or odd number.

The goal for each player is to complete the course in the lowest number of strokes overall, known as the gross score, and to have the fewest strokes at each hole, known as the net score after accounting for handicaps.

Each hole is played once in the round on a standard golf course.

Players attempt to hit the golf ball from the teeing ground to the green and into the hole with the fewest strokes possible. The game's scoring system is designed to minimize points, not to maximize them. The player who scores the lowest number of strokes is the winner, as this indicates the best performance in terms of accuracy, distance control, and consistency.\n\nIn golf, a lower score is better, and the winner is the one with the highest score in a match play format, which might seem counterintuitive at first. However, in this context, the player who wins the hole in match play is the one who scores the lowest number of strokes, and hence \"higher\" score in match play signifies a loss. In stroke play tournaments, the player with the lowest total score after all holes are played is the winner. \n\nTherefore, while the terms \"higher score\" and \"win\" are used in the context of golf, they are relative to the competition and refer to the lowest scorers winning the holes or the tournament, respectively, not an actual pursuit of a higher point total.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt=\"\"\"\nQuestion: Part of golf is trying to get a higher point total than others.

Therefore, trying to get a higher point total than others is not part of the goal in golf.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install openai","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-02T12:02:06.189511Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-02T12:02:06.190581Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-02T12:02:23.427998Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-02T12:02:06.190543Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-02T12:02:23.426339Z"},"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting openai\n  Downloading openai-1.35.7-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (21 kB)\nRequirement already satisfied: anyio<5,>=3.5.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from openai) (4.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: distro<2,>=1.7.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from openai) (1.9.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: httpx<1,>=0.23.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from openai) (0.27.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pydantic<3,>=1.9.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from openai) (2.5.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: sniffio in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from openai) (1.3.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: tqdm>4 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from openai) (4.66.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: typing-extensions<5,>=4.7 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from openai) (4.9.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: idna>=2.8 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from anyio<5,>=3.5.0->openai) (3.6)\nRequirement already satisfied: exceptiongroup>=1.0.2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from anyio<5,>=3.5.0->openai) (1.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: certifi in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from httpx<1,>=0.23.0->openai) (2024.2.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: httpcore==1.* in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from httpx<1,>=0.23.0->openai) (1.0.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: h11<0.15,>=0.13 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from httpcore==1.*->httpx<1,>=0.23.0->openai) (0.14.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: annotated-types>=0.4.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from pydantic<3,>=1.9.0->openai) (0.6.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pydantic-core==2.14.6 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from pydantic<3,>=1.9.0->openai) (2.14.6)\nDownloading openai-1.35.7-py3-none-any.whl (327 kB)\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m327.5/327.5 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0ma \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0mm\n\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: openai\nSuccessfully installed openai-1.35.7\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import openai\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nload_dotenv()\n \nTOGETHER_API_KEY = '712a37a9e3b4c26d7c6560b7e56e7b94a42c08bf884298828664eaee75ed2c03'\n \nclient = openai.OpenAI(\n    api_key=TOGETHER_API_KEY,\n    base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\",\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-02T12:02:35.773483Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-02T12:02:35.773952Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-02T12:02:36.770976Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-02T12:02:35.773915Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-02T12:02:36.769840Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_code_completion(messages, max_tokens=512, model=\"codellama/CodeLlama-70b-Instruct-hf\"):\n    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n        messages=messages,\n        model=model,\n        max_tokens=max_tokens,\n        stop=[\n            \"<step>\"\n        ],\n        frequency_penalty=1,\n        presence_penalty=1,\n        top_p=0.7,\n        n=10,\n        temperature=0.7,\n    )\n \n    return chat_completion","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-07-02T12:02:55.942791Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-07-02T12:02:55.943320Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-07-02T12:02:55.949560Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-07-02T12:02:55.943285Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-07-02T12:02:55.948489Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"messages = [\n      {\n            \"role\": \"system\",\n            \"content\": \"You are an expert programmer that helps to write Python code based on the user request, with concise explanations.

Here is a simple and efficient way to generate the nth Fibonacci number in Python using dynamic programming (DP): ```py def fib(n):    if n == 0 or n == 1:\\        return n\\    else:\\        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)``` In this implementation, we use recursion to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. However, it's not very efficient because of its exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations for overlapping subproblems. To improve performance, you can use memoization or tabulation techniques instead of recursion. If you need help with those approaches, feel free to ask! 🤓\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
